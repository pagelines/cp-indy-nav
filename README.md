Indy Nav section
===================
Indy Nav is a fork of the Navbar section but you can customize every item's color, disable mobile menu, and customize mobile menu's button text.

It can display parents, children, and grandchildren (3 levels) but does not display an image or search box (except on mobile nav because that's part of DMS default, not Indy Nav).

Indy Nav... make it your own!
